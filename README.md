# Pycon UK Introductory Tutorial

*This tutorial is a condensed version of the one delivered at Pycon UK 2014. The original tutorial
can be found [here](https://github.com/savarin/pyconuk-introtutorial/tree/4b3147e3bb1f69f3642dc55df0aa05ac9ca234d3). For an introduction to neural networks, please visit [Neural Networks in a Nutshell](https://github.com/savarin/neural-networks).*

## Installation
This tutorial requires *jupyter*, *pandas* and *scikit-learn*. These can be installed with *pip* by
typing the following in terminal:

	pip install jupyterlab pandas sklearn

We will be reviewing the materials with Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to type
	
	jupyter-lab
	
in your terminal window and see the notebook panel load in your web browser.


## Tutorial

The tutorial will start with data manipulation using pandas - loading and cleaning data. We'll then
use scikit-learn to make predictions. By the end of the session, we would have worked on the [Kaggle
Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from start to finish, through a number of
iterations in an increasing order of sophistication.
